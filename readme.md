Adding Coupons
==============
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard >  Product > Coupons > Create a coupon.
2. Type in the coupon’s name: it can be anything and for your reference only.
  Type in the Coupon’s ID: This is the Coupon code that your students will need to enter if they want to avail of the discount.

  Choose Coupon Type: 
    1. Percentage discount: offers % off on the course price 
    2. Fixed amount discount: Offers a fixed amount off on the course price.

  Duration: For the duration, when using the value repeating, also specify the duration in months as the number of months for which the coupon should repeatedly apply. Otherwise, the coupon can be set to apply only to a single invoice or to them all.

Redemption: The max_redemptions and redeem_by values apply to the coupon across every customer you have. For example, you can restrict a coupon to the first 50 customers that use it, or you can make a coupon expire by a certain date. If you do the latter, this only impacts when the coupon can be applied to a customer. 
If you set a coupon to last forever when used by a customer, but have it expire on January 1st, any customer is given that coupon will have that coupon’s discount forever, but no new customers can apply the coupon after January 1st.

If a coupon has a max_redemptions value of 50, it can only be applied among all your customers a total of 50 times, although there’s nothing preventing a single customer from using it multiple times. (You can always use logic on your end to prevent that from occurring.)

This completes all the steps from the administrator end. Now registered users can log in to the Moodle site and view the course after successful payment of the discounted price.
